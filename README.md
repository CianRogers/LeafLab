# Plant Disease Recognition System

Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! ðŸŒ¿ðŸ”Ž

This app is designed to help users identify plant diseases from images of plant leaves using a pre-trained TensorFlow model. Simply upload an image, and the app will process it to predict the type of disease affecting the plant.

# Features
Disease Recognition: Upload an image of a plant leaf, and the app will identify the disease.
Interactive Dashboard: Easily navigate through different sections like Home, About, and Disease Recognition.
Detailed Results: Get predictions along with the names of potential diseases affecting the plant.
How It Works
Model Prediction: A TensorFlow model, trained on a comprehensive dataset, predicts the disease from the uploaded image.
Sidebar Navigation: Switch between different pages using the sidebar.
Image Upload and Display: Upload an image and see it displayed within the app.
Prediction and Results: The app processes the image to identify the disease and shows the result with a detailed description.
